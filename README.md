# Description

Toolhunt is a web application for editing Toolhub records in a fun and easy way.
It allows users to view and add missing fields for tools in Toolhub.

This repository contains the project backend.
The frontend can be found in the [toolhunt-ui repository](https://github.com/wikimedia/toolhunt-ui).

This is an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Internship project.

Notes to self (incorporate this better into the README later)
To get this to actually work I had to:

1. install poetry
2. use pip to install flask
3. run `poetry run flask app.py`
4. what is the point of poetry again????????
